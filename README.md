### Web Accessibility
WAI-ARIA specifications have been observed within a reasonable margin to allow for use of Screen Readers and Assistive Technologies (tests were conducted using NVDA Assistive Technology).

### Component Files Minimized
All component CSS and JS files have been condensed, compressed and minimized as have all main display images been resized to optimize load speed.

### Sitemap
An XML sitemap as per the [Sitemap 0.90 Protocol](http://www.sitemaps.org/) has been included in the build to help optimize Search Engine crawling.

##Overview:

### ASP Server Language
Website was built using classic ASP to minimize complications between source file crossover on existing server. The option to reframe website using updated ASP is open.

### Browser Compatibility and Graceful Degradation
Website is compatible with all current browsers including IE9 and above (users of IE8 and earlier will receive a warning to upgrade). Website is also able to function without JavaScript (not including mobile devices).

### Responsive Design
Website follows a responsive design and has been optimized to work on mobile devices (iPad, iPhone)

### Future Extensibility
A placeholder for a 'Careers' page has been placed into the code to allow for addition of a careers page.

### Web Accessibility
WAI-ARIA specifications have been observed within a reasonable margin to allow for use of Screen Readers and Assistive Technologies.

### Component Files Minimized
All component files have been minimized and all main display images have been resized to optimize load speed.

### Sitemap
An XML sitemap as per the [Sitemap 0.90 Protocol](http://www.sitemaps.org/) has been included in the build to help optimize Search Engine crawling.

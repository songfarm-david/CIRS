		    <p>
			    In-home sprinklers are becoming more popular than ever. Small pot light-looking ceiling fixtures are mounted throughout the home to monitor heat and disperse water to put out the fire threat.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    Fire safety systems are a cost-effective add-on/upgrade option to an in-floor heating installation.  They provide peace-of-mind and may earn you a reduction in your insurance rates.

			    We use premium Uponor PEX-a tubing in all fire safety system installations. Without soldered joints itâ€™s extremely durable and virtually leak-proof.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    Sprinklers work quickly and put out most fires in seconds, even before the fire department arrives, and can significantly reduce damage.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    Uponor AquaSAFE&trade; Systems are very reliable. The tubing used is backed by a 25-year limited warranty when installed by an Uponor-trained professional. Sprinklers respond to heat not smoke, and draw water from your main cold water line and the odds of a malfunction are just one in 16 million.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    While smoke detectors alone increase survival rates by 50%, adding sprinklers increases that to an incredible 97%.

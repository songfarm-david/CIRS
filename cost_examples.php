			    <h1 class="full-width">What Does Radiant In-Floor Heating Cost?</h1>
			    <p>
				    One of the factors affecting the cost of an in-floor radiant heating installation is the method that will be used to heat the hot water.
			    </p>
			    <p>
				    On small-to-medium sized residential projects we are often able to use your existing hot water heater. We install a unit called a "radiant X-Block" <span aria-hidden="true">(X-Block).</span> This pumps hot water from your water heater, through a heat exchanger, to heat your floor. The water in the floor does not come in contact with the rest of your hot water. The cost of the X-Block and installation is approximately <span aria-hidden="true">$3000.00.</span><span class="sr-only">Three-thousand dollars</span>
			    </p>
			    <p>
				    With a larger project, a full boiler system must be installed that can heat your radiant domestic hot water, pool, driveway, etc. A boiler room build will typically cost approximately <span aria-hidden="true">$13,000.00.</span><span class="sr-only">Thirteen-thousand dollars</span>
			    </p>
			    <p>
				    When a gypsum pour is required, there are some minimum costs involved that ultimately make the per square foot costs somewhat higher on smaller projects.
			    </p>
			    <p>
				    Radiant heating system installations that take place during the construction of a new home tend be more cost-efficient compared to retrofits into existing homes or installations during renovations.
			    </p>

				    Below are a few samples of typical projects you can use to get a ball park idea as to costs.

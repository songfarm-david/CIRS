		    <h3>What Does Radiant In-Floor Heating Cost?</h3>
		    <p>
			    One of the factors affecting the cost of an in-floor radiant heating installation is the method that will be used to heat the hot water.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    On small-to-medium sized residential projects we are often able to use your existing hot water heater. We install a unit called a "radiant X-Block" (X-Block). This pumps hot water from your water heater, through a heat exchanger, to heat your floor. The water in the floor does not come in contact with the rest of your hot water. The cost of the X-Block and installation is approximately $3000.00.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    With a larger project, a full boiler system must be installed that can heat your radiant, domestic hot water, pool, driveway, etc. A boiler room build will typically cost approximately $13,000.00.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    When a gypsum pour is required, there are some minimum costs involved that ultimately make the per square foot costs somewhat higher on smaller projects.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    Radiant heating system installations that take place during the construction of a new home tend be more cost-efficient compared to retrofits into existing homes or installations during renovations.
		    </p>
		    <p>
			    Below are a few samples of typical projects you can use to get a ball park idea as to costs.
